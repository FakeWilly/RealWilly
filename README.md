## üëã About Me

I'm Wilson Collins, a passionate physicist and Python developer with a particular interest in quantum physics. My background combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on experimentation through backyard laboratories where I build and test innovative solutions.

I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to understand fundamental principles through both computational modeling and physical experimentation. My approach bridges theory and practice - from coding simulations of quantum systems to constructing DIY spectrometers that bring theoretical concepts into the physical world.

Currently, I'm focused on expanding my Python skills to enhance my experimental work and data analysis capabilities. I believe in the power of open-source science and leveraging technology to make scientific exploration more accessible.
